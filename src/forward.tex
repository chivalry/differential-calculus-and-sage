Added 2007: For further information on William granville, please see the
Wikipedia article at
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Anthony_Granville}, which has a
short biography and links for further information.

Granville's book ``Elements of the Differential and Integral Calculus'' fell
into the public domain and then much of it (but not all, at the time of this
writing) was scanned into
{\scriptsize{\url{http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Elements_of_the_Differential_and_Integral_Calculus}}}
primarily by P.~J. Hall. This wikisource document uses MathML and \LaTeX\ and
some Greek letter fonts. The current \LaTeX\ document is due to David Joyner,
who is responsible for the formatting, editing for readability, the correction
of any typos in the scanned version, and any extra material added (for example,
the hyperlinked cross references, and the \SAGE material). Please email
corrections to {\tt wdjoyner@gmail.com}. In particular, the existence of this
document owes itself primarily to three great open source projects: \TeX{}/\LaTeX\,
Wikipedia, and \SAGE. More information on \SAGE can be found at the \SAGE
website (\url{http://www.sagemath.org}).  Some material from Sean Mauch's
public domain text on Applied Mathematics,
\url{http://www.its.caltech.edu/~sean/book.html} was also included.

Though the original text of Granville is public domain, the extra material added in this version is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (please see
\url{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html}), as is most of Wikipedia.
