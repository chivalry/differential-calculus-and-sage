\section{The derivative considered as the ratio of two rates}

Let

\[
    y = f(x)
\]
be the equation of a curve generated by a moving point P. 
Its coordinates $x$ and $y$ may then be considered as functions 
of the time, as explained in \S \ref{sec:71}. %ยง 71, p. 91.
Differentiating with respect to $t$, by the chain rule 
(Formula XXV in \S \ref{sec:33}), we have

\begin{equation}
%(32) 
\frac{dy}{dt} = f'(x) \frac{dx}{dt}.
\label{eqn:32-94}
\end{equation}
{\it At any instant the time rate of change of $y$ (or the function) 
equals its derivative multiplied by the time rate change of the 
independent variable.}

Or, write (\ref{eqn:32-94}) in the form

\[
%(33) 
\frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}} = f'(x) = \frac{dy}{dx}.
\]
{\it The derivative measures the ratio of the time rate of 
change of $y$ to that of $x$.}

$\frac{ds}{dt}$ being the time rate of change of length 
of arc, we have from (\ref{eqn:12-71}), % p. 92 [ยง71],

\begin{equation}
%(34) 
\frac{ds}{dt} 
= \sqrt{\left ( \frac{dx}{dt} \right )^2 + \left ( \frac{dt}{dt} \right )^2}.
\label{eqn:34-94}
\end{equation}
which is the relation indicated by Figure \ref{fig:two-rates}.

As a guide in solving rate problems use the following rule:

\begin{itemize}
\item
FIRST STEP. Draw a figure illustrating the problem. 
Denote by $x$, $y$, $z$, etc., the quantities which vary with the time.

\item
SECOND STEP. Obtain a relation between the variables 
involved which will hold true at any instant.

\item
THIRD STEP. Differentiate with respect to the time.

\item
FOURTH STEP. Make a list of the given and required quantities.

\item
FIFTH STEP. Substitute the known quantities in the result 
found by differentiating (third step), and solve for the unknown.
\end{itemize}



\section{Exercises}


\begin{enumerate}

\item
%1
A man is walking at the rate of $5$ miles per hour towards the foot 
of a tower $60$ ft. high. At what rate is he approaching the 
top when he is $80$ ft. from the foot of the tower?

Solution. Apply the above rule.

First step. Draw the figure. Let $x$ = distance of the man from 
the foot and $y$ = his distance from the top of the tower at any instant.

Second step. Since we have a right triangle,
$\ y^2 	= x^2 + 3600$.

Third step. Differentiating, we get
$2 y \frac{dy}{dt} 	= 2 x \frac{dx}{dt}$, or,
%(A) 
$\frac{dy}{dt} 	= \frac{x}{y} \frac{dx}{dt}$, 
meaning that at any instant whatever
(Rate of change of $y$) = $\left ( \frac{x}{y} \right )$ 
(rate of change of $x$).

Fourth step. 

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
 x &	= 80,\ 	\frac{dx}{dt} 	= 5\ {\rm miles/hour},\\
  &= 5 \times 5280 ft/hour,\\
y &	= \sqrt{x^2 + 3600}\\
  &	= 100.\\
 \frac{dy}{dt}& 	= ?
\end{array}
\]
Fifth step. 	Substituting back in the above %(A),
$\frac{dy}{dt} 	= \frac{80}{100} \times 5 \times 5280$
ft/hour = $4$ miles/hour. 

\item
%2
A point moves on the parabola $6y = x^2$ in such a way that when 
$x = 6$, the abscissa is increasing at the rate of $2$ ft. per second. 
At what rates are the ordinate and length of arc increasing at the 
same instant?

Solution. First step. Plot the parabola.

Second step. $6 y 	= x^2$.

Third step. $6 \frac{dy}{dt} 	= 2 x\frac{dx}{dt}$, or,
%(B) 	
$\frac{dy}{dt} 	= \frac{x}{3} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt}$.
This means that at any point on the parabola
(Rate of change of ordinate) 	
= $\left( \frac{x}{3} \right)$ (rate of change of abcissa).

Fourth step. $\frac{dx}{dt} 	= 2$ ft. per second,
$x = 6$, $\frac{dy}{dt} = ?$, 
$y = \frac{x^2}{6} = 6$, $\frac{ds}{dt} = ?$

Fifth step. Substituting back in the above, %(B),
$\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{6}{3} \times 2 = 4$ ft. per second. 

From the first result we note that at the point 
$(6, 6)$ the ordinate changes twice as rapidly as the abscissa.

If we consider the point $(-6, 6)$ instead, the result is 
$\frac{dy}{dt} = -4$ ft. per second, the minus sign indicating 
that the ordinate is decreasing as the abscissa increases.

We shall now solve this using \sage.

\noindent
This tells us that 
$\frac{dy}{dt} =\frac{x}{3} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt}$ and

\[
\frac{ds}{dt} =\frac{ y(t)y'(t) +  x(t)x'(t)}{\sqrt{ x(t)^2  + y(t)^2}}.
\]
Substituting $\frac{dx}{dt} = 2$, $x = 6$, gives
$\frac{dy}{dt} = 4$. In addition, if $y=6$ then this gives
$\frac{ds}{dt} = 36/\sqrt{72}=3\sqrt{2}$.

\item
%3
A circular plate of metal expands by heat so that its radius 
increases uniformly at the rate of $0.01$ inch per second.
At what rate is the surface increasing when the radius is two inches?

Solution. Let $x$ = radius and y = area of plate. Then
$ y 	= \pi x^2$,
%(C) 	
$\frac{dy}{dt} 	= 2 \pi x \frac{dx}{dt}$,
That is; at any instant the area of the plate is increasing 
in square inches $2\pi x$ times as fast as the radius is 
increasing in linear inches.
$\ x 	= 2$, $\frac{dx}{dt} = 0.01$, 
$\frac{dy}{dt} = ?$.
Substituting in the above, %(C),
$\frac{dy}{dt} 	= 2 \pi \times 2 \times 0.01 = 0.04 \pi$ 
sq. in. per sec. 

\item
%4
An arc light is hung $12$ ft. directly above a straight 
horizontal walk on which a boy $5$ ft. in height is walking. 
How fast is the boy's shadow lengthening when he is walking 
away from the light at the rate of 168 ft. per minute?

Solution. Let $x$ = distance of boy from a point directly 
under light $L$, and $y$ = length of boy's shadow. 
By similar triangle, %From the figure,
$y/( y + x) = 5/12$,
or $ y 	= \frac{5}{7} x$.
Differentiating, $\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{5}{7} \frac{dx}{dt}$;
i.e. the shadow is lengthening $\frac{5}{7}$ as fast as 
the boy is walking, or $120$ ft. per minute.

\item

If the sun is just rising in the east, find how fast the shadow 
$S$ of the locomotive $L$ is moving along the wall of the station 
at the instant it reaches the end of the wall.

Solution. $y^2 	= 600x$,
$2 y \frac{dy}{dt} 	= 600 \frac{dx}{dt}$,
or $\frac{dx}{dt} 	= \frac{y}{300} \frac{dy}{dt}$.
Substituting this value of $\frac{dx}{dt}$ in
$\frac{ds}{dt} 	
= \sqrt{\left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 
+ \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2}$, we get
%(D) 	
$\left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right)^2 
= \left( \frac{y}{300} \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2 
+ \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2$.
Now $\frac{ds}{dt} 	= 15$ miles per hour = $22$ ft. per sec.,
$y= 400$ and $\frac{dy}{dt} = ?$.
Substituting back in the above, %(D), 
we get
$
 ( 22 )^2 	
= \left( \frac{16}{9} + 1 \right) \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2$,
or, 
$\frac{dy}{dt} 	
= 13 \frac{1}{5}$ ft. per second.
