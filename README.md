# Differential Calculus and SAGE
An update to David Joyner's edits of William Graville's calculus textbook.

This project has the following goals for updating the free *Differential Calculus and SAGE* textbook TeX source:

1. Correct errors in math equations.
2. Correct typos.
3. Synchronize output builds (PDF, HTML).

Additional possible goals (depending on my future education as to whether these are possible or desireable):

1. Automate figure generation from SAGE source code.
2. Include complete exercise answers.
